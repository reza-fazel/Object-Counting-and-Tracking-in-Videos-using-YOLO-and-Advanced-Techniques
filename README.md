# Object Counting and-Tracking in-Videos using YOLO8 and Advanced Techniques

This code is a vehicle counting and tracking system using YOLO8 object detection and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. It takes input from a video file, applies a mask to define the detection region, and uses YOLO8 to identify vehicles. The SORT algorithm is then used to track these vehicles over frames. The code displays the total count of detected
